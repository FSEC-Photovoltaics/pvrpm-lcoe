Logic Diagram
=================================

  :hidden:

Here is a set of diagrams to understand how the simulation runs. Each module has a set of functions: init, reinit, and update. Init describes the logic to handle on the initial creation at the beginning of the simulation. Reinit describes how to reinitalize components that are repaired. Update gives the logic of what happens each day of the simulation.
